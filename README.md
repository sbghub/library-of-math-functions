# Library of Math Functions

# Usage
1. Clone library-of-math-functions into the directory you'd want to use it from
2. You should be able to import "math_library.py" into the .py file you'd want to use it from

2a. Run a series of tests on these functions with "$ python test_math_library.py"

# Description
This is a library of functions that handle common mathematical concepts one might find in things like math puzzles

Functions in this library that only take integer inputs will translate integer-ish inputs to integers (e.g. "-1.0" -> -1). This is for greater flexibility with inputs and simpler usage of our functions
